### What is a map ?

A Two-dimensional representation of all or part of our planet  


.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt = "A 3D globe.", fig.cap= "3D globe"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Globe3D_rgl.gif")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt = "Map showing a range in values in which values in red are low values and values in green are high values.", fig.cap = "map showing a range in values."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/GamPred-1.jpg")
```

_Sorry no..._
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.alt = "Outer space. A flat earth and a round moon and sun in orbit.", fig.cap= "A flat earth."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flat_earth.jpeg")
```

### What is a projection?

The source of most of your problems in cartography...

<!-- - In 2D, maps are always represented using a projected reference system -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.alt= "Examples of cylindrical, conic, and azimuthal projections listed vertically along with examples of secant and tangental projections of each type listed horizontally, and the indicators of the angles for secant and tangental projections which is listed next to the cylindrical, conic, and azimuthal examples on the left side of the example. The cylindrical projection example has a paper wrapped around a globe in a cylinder shape. The conical projection example has a paper wrapped around the globe in a cone shape. The azimuthal projection example has a flat disk touching the North pole. For cylindrical projections, the angle equals zero degrees. For conic, the angle is greater than zero and less than 90 degrees. For Azimuthal, the angle equals 90 degrees. These type of projections can be further divided into tangent and secant projections. More information about tangent and secant projections are listed to the right of the tangent and secant cylindrical project examples respectively. Tangent based projections have more scale expansion, is on a standard parallel and more scale expansion. Secant projections has less scale expansion, scale compression, and less scale expansion.", fig.cap = "Types of map projections."}

### What is a projection?

- In R, you will talk about `CRS` (Coordinates Reference System)
- You need to know the projection of your datasets

> Use the name of the CRS in the name of your spatial object!
This will prevent you from making many mistakes...

The top text mentions 'sf versions < 0.9' and '> 0.9 (released 2020-03-24)' in two columns. Below the 'sf versions < 0.9' text, there is text that says 'the coordinate reference system is represented by a list with two components: epsg and proj4string.' Below the 'sf version > 0.9 (released 2020-03-24)' text, there is text that says 'coordinate reference system is represented by a list with two components input and wkt.'", fig.cap = "Coordinate Reference System description."}

### Geographic objects (entities)



```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.alt= "Types of vector and raster data shown in a cut out of six different layers. The topmost three layers are vector data in which the top layer is points, then lines, then polygons. Red points represent customers, black lines with grey halos surrounding the black lines represent streets, and polygons represent parcels which are various shapes and colors. The bottom two layers are raster data which shows data in a grid format in which each grid is shaded different colors such as brown, yellow, green and grey. The top most raster layer represents elevation, the bottom layer represents land usage. The bottom-most layer represents the real world and shows a cutout of a city which represented by high rise buildings and a suburban area which is represented by houses. A river is separating the suburban area and the city. A highway is on the left of the city. Below the top-most layer of this cutout, you can see the ground sediment layers in which there is a brown top-most layer, a water layer, and then a grey rocky area as the bottom layer.", fig.cap = "Types of vector and raster data."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/vector_raster.gif")
```

### Vector objects

Geographic objects (entities):

- Points: entities without surface and which cannot be represented by lines

- Lines (arcs) :
    + Objects too narrow to be described by a surface (street, river -depending on the scale of representation-)
    + Objects with a length but no surface (coastline, departmental boundaries...)
    
- Polygons: Homogeneous surface objects (island, building,...)

Storage is done in a single database or in several files  
> One layer = one type of entity

---


### Raster objects (rasters)

The storage is done in the form of a rectangular matrix of values

.pull-left[
- Decomposition of regular meshes into grids

- Each mesh (=pixel) has a specific value related to its representation attribute (quality)

- A raster is defined by:
    + Its geographical extension
        + Number of rows, columns and geographical position (corner)
        
    + Its spatial resolution
        + Mesh size + Mesh size  
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt= "Raster data representation which a grid of zeros, ones, and twos which represents different classes of an entity.", fig.cap= "Raster data representation."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/raster.png")
```
]  

---

### Packages for reading geographic data in R

- Past: {sp} + {rgdal} + {rgeos} + {raster}
- Current packages:
  + {sf} : reading and manipulation of vector type data
      + {tidyverse} style
  + {stars} : reading and manipulation of space-time raster data
      + {tidyverse} style
  + {terra} : reading, manipulation and processing of rasters
      + Improved version of {raster}

---
class: slide

### Quiz: What is the **first** question to ask yourself when you have a problem with your spatial data manipulations?


+ A: Did I reboot my computer?   

+ B: What is the projection?  

+ C: What is the format of my spatial data?   

+ D: Who taught me this stuff? Doris? Dorris? Whatever her name is. 


---

### Summary

- Projections: The main problem to deal with in cartography,

- Projections: Different depending on spatial extent of datasets,  

- Vector data: Points coordinates with attributes table
  + Lines: points ordered and linked by a line,
  + Polygons: points ordered and linked by a line that closes on itself.

- Rasters data: regular grid of data.

# Spatial vectors data: read & project

## Everything is fine with {sf}

---

### {sf} : Read geographical datasets

Read with `read_sf()`:

- All formats handled by GDAL (http://www.gdal.org/)
    + CSV, Mapinfo, Google Earth, GeoJSON, PostGIS, ...
- ESRI shapefile
    + Among most used
    + Minimum of **four** files (shp, shx, dbf, prj)
- GeoPackage
    + New format standard
    + To be preferred

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# dataWD <- "data"
departements_l93 <- read_sf(
  dsn = here::here("data/departements"),
  layer = "departement",
  quiet = TRUE)
study_area_l93 <- read_sf(here::here("data/departements/area_l93.gpkg"))
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Map of France departments
departements_l93 <- read_sf("data/departements/departement.shp")
# Limits of a study area
study_area_l93 <- read_sf("data/departements/area_l93.gpkg")
```

---

### Projections

- Get coordinates reference system: `st_crs()`

```{r}
st_crs(departements_l93)
```

---

### Projections

- Project layer into new coordinates reference system: `st_transform()`

```{r}
# Transform into geographic coordinates system
departements_wgs84 <- departements_l93 %>%  
  st_transform(crs = 4326) # EPSG = 4326

st_crs(departements_wgs84)
```

---

### Read text file with coordinates

- Read a csv, txt, xls, ... with the adapted package 
    + {readr}, {readxl}, ...

```{r,  eval=FALSE}
cafes_bars <- read_csv("data/cafes_bars.csv")
cafes_bars
```
```{r, fig.alt= "list of cafes and bars in France which is categorized  by amenity, timestamp, user, id, longitude, and latitude.", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Teacher - Read data
cafes_bars <- read_csv(here::here("data/cafes_bars.csv"))
cafes_bars
```

---

### Read text file with coordinates

- Use `st_as_sf()` to transform into spatial dataset

```{r, fig.alt= "Map of France showing the first administrative divisions (departments) projected in WGS84. There are also grey dots on the map, but it is uncertain what they indicate. The x-axis has longitude lines from 0 degrees to 10 degrees east (indicated by 'E'). The y-axis has latitude lines from 42 degrees north to 50 degrees north (indicated by 'N')."}
cafes_bars_wgs84 <- cafes_bars %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lng", "lat"), crs = 4326)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="52%"}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = departements_l93) +
  geom_sf(data = cafes_bars_wgs84, 
          size = 0.5,
          colour = "grey20",
          alpha = 0.3)
```

---

### Write spatial dataset on disk

Write with `write_sf()` :

- All formats handled by GDAL (http://www.gdal.org/)
    + CSV, Mapinfo, Google Earth, GeoJSON, PostGIS, Shp, ...
- GPKG format (GeoPackage)
    + New standard of OGC
    + Recommended

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_sf(point_wgs84, "new-directory/point_wgs84.gpkg")
```

---
class: slide, no-margin

### Quiz: What is the correct way to deal with the following text file with coordinates to be used as a spatial points dataset?

- Let `"data_coords.txt"` be a text file at the root of your project
- Position of points was taken using a GPS in France
- Note: `2154`: Lambert 93, France, projected; `4326`: Geographical coordinates 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(
  lat = c(48.5, 49, 47),
  lng = c(2, 2.5, 3),
  sample = c("A", "B", "C")
)
```

.pull-left[
+ A
```{r, eval=FALSE}
d_text <- read_txt("data_coords.txt")
pts_wgs84 <- d_text %>% 
      st_as_sf(coords = c("lng", "lat"),
               crs = 4326)
```
+ B
```{r, eval=FALSE}
d_text <- read_txt("data_coords.txt")
pts_wgs84 <- d_text %>% 
      st_transform(crs = 4326)
```
]
.pull-right[
+ C 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
d_text <- read_txt("data_coords.txt")
pts_l93 <- d_text %>% 
      st_as_sf(coords = c("lat", "lng"),
               crs = 2154)
```
+ D
```{r, eval=FALSE}
pts_wgs84 <- read_sf("data_coords.txt")
```
]

???

A: Correct answer

B: `st_transform()` applies to data that are already spatial datasets. Here we have a classical text file, a classical dataframe.

C: `st_as_sf()` specifies the crs of the data inside the dataset. Not a targeted crs. If you want to change the crs, then use `st_transform()` afterwards

D: You cannot read the text file with `read_sf()` as is. This is not already a spatial dataset, even if there are some columns somewhere inside with spatial coordinates.

---

### Summary

- Package : {sf}
- Read : `read_sf()`
- Write : `write_sf()`
- Get projection : `st_crs()`
- Transform, Project : `st_transform()`
- Text file into spatial : `st_as_sf()`

### Do you really want to draw a map?

- What is your question?
- What message do you want to communicate?
- Can the map deliver this message in 3 seconds?
- **Only use maps if the spatial distribution (pattern) is meaningful**

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt = "Bar chart on the number of cafes per department in France. The values on the x axis range from zero to twenty-five. While the units are uncertain, one could guess the number represents thousands. The y-axis has the name of the departments Lot-Et-Garonne and Jura has the most cafes and bars with around 28, followed by Ardennes which has 25, Creuse which has around 23, Tam-El-Garoone which has around 22, Gers which has around 18, Haute-Marne which has around 14, Meuse which has around 12, Haute-Saone which has around eight, and Teritorre De Belfort which has around three.", fig.cap = "Number of cafes per department in France.", fig.cap = "Bar chart on the number of cafes per department in France."}

### Visualisation rules

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", fig.alt= "Visualization rules. Top of the graphic says 'Does the average make sense?' There are arrows that point to either 'yes' or 'no' below the question. If 'no', then you use qualitative data. There is a graphic below that text which shows lands cover classes. Artifical surfaces are represented by red, yellow is represented by agricultural areas, and green is represented by forest and other natural areas. If yes, the second level text says 'Does the sum make sense?' and there are arrows that point to 'yes' and 'no.' If 'yes', then use absolute quantitative data which uses sizes to express proportionality. Below that text is a graphic that shows total population by red square size which is laid over some land boundaries. The smallest square is 100, followed by 20,000, then 80,000, and finally 150,000. If 'no', then use relative quantitative data which uses color values to express order and relative differences. Below that text is a graphic that is showing the unemployment rate in land boundaries by percentage. A light color hue is low unemployment while a darker color of yellow indicates high unemployment."}

class: slide

### Read some spatial data

- `read_sf()` from `{sf}` can read shapefiles (`.shp`) and many more file spatial vector formats

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Prepare Europe dataset
data("World", package = "tmap")
europe <- World %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe" &
           name != "France") 
write_sf(europe, here::here("data/europe/europe.gpkg"), delete_layer = TRUE, quiet = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# For teacher - invisible
# vector
departements_l93 <- read_sf(
  dsn = here("data/departements"),
  layer = "departement",
  quiet = TRUE)
# Points
cafes_bars_l93 <- read_sf(here("data/cafes_bars/cafes_bars.shp"), quiet = TRUE)
# Europe
europe <- read_sf(here("data/europe/europe.gpkg"), quiet = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
# Read included dataset
# Use the tabulation for auto-completion of path
europe <- read_sf("data/europe/europe.gpkg")
departements_l93 <- read_sf("data/departements/departement.shp")
cafes_bars_l93 <- read_sf("data/cafes_bars/cafes_bars.shp")

getwd()
```

### Vector data format

- With {sf}, data are rectangular

```{r, include=FALSE, fig.alt= "Description of departments in rectangular form.Information that is in this data frame include but is not exclusive to the ID, department code, name of the department, the department code, and the x, and y coordinates." }
# Teacher
departements_l93 <- read_sf(

  layer = "departement",
  quiet = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
# Read example data
# vector
departements_l93 <- read_sf("data/departements/departement.shp")
# Text file - number of inhabitants
dept_inhabitants <- read_csv("data/departements/repartition_dpt_clean_2015.csv")
```
```{r}

### Operations on rows and columns

All that you know with {dplyr} works on {sf} objects
+ `%>%`
+ `select`, `mutate` for attributs (= columns)
+ `filter`, `arrange` for entities (= rows)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
bretagne_l93 <- 
  departements_l93 %>% 
  mutate(NOM_DEPT = str_to_title(NOM_DEPT)) %>% 
  select(CODE_DEPT, NOM_DEPT, NOM_REG) %>% 
  filter(NOM_REG == "BRETAGNE")
```

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE, out.width="55%", fig.alt= "A map of departments in the Bretagne region.The x-axis has longitude lines that ranges from 5 degrees west to one degree west (indicated by 'W'). The y-axis has latitude lines that ranges from 47.5 degrees north to 48.5 degrees north (indicated by 'N'). Each department is colored different. Cotes-D'armor is colored in purple, Finistere is colored in blue, Ille-Et-Vilalne is colored in green, and Morbihan is colored in yellow.", fig.cap= "Bretagne region of France.", fig.cap = "Bretagne region of France."}
ggplot(bretagne_l93) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = NOM_DEPT)) +

### Grouped operations

- Merge entities with `group_by` + `summarize`

```{r, echo=TRUE}
region_l93 <- departements_l93 %>% 
  group_by(NOM_REG) %>% 
  summarize()
```

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt= "Map of all of the departments of France which are colored by region. There are twelve regions. The x-axis ranges from zero degrees to 10 degrees east (indicated by 'E'). The y-axis ranges from 42 degrees north to 50 degrees north (indicated by 'N').", fig.cap= "Map of all of the departments of France."}
ggplot(departements_l93) +
  aes(fill = NOM_REG) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(crs = 2154, datum = 4326) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 16)) +
  labs(title = "Departments")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt= "The second map shows the twelve regions of France which was created by a group_by and summarize dplyr verbs which dissolves the department boundaries and shows regional boundaries. Each region is a different color. The x-axis ranges from zero degrees to 10 degrees east (indicated by 'E'). The y-axis ranges from 42 degrees north to 50 degrees north (indicated by 'N')", fig.cap= "The second map shows the regions of France which was created by a group_by and summarize dplyr verbs."}
ggplot(region_l93) +
  aes(fill = NOM_REG) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(crs = 2154, datum = 4326) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Regions") +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 16))
```

### Join with classical datasets

- Between shapefile and dataset with `*_join`
  + `left_join()`, `inner_join()`, `full_join()`, ...
  + Read external classical dataset
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Text file - number of inhabitants
dept_inhabitants <- read_csv(here::here("data/departements/repartition_dpt_clean_2015.csv"))
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Text file - number of inhabitants
dept_inhabitants <- read_csv("data/departements/repartition_dpt_clean_2015.csv")
```
  + Content of shapefile: `departements_l93`
```{r}
departements_l93
```

### Join with classical datasets

- Between shapefile and dataset with `*_join`

.pull-left[
- Department shapefile `departements_l93`  

```{r}
# Shapefile of the departments.
glimpse(departements_l93, width = 30)
```
]
.pull-right[
- Number of inhabitants by age by department in `dept_inhabitants`

```{r, message = FALSE}
# CSV with information about inhabitants in each department
glimpse(dept_inhabitants, width = 30)
```
]

---
class: slide, no-margin

### Join with classical datasets

```{r, fig.cap= "Joining the csv file to the shapefile by keys"}
# Join database with shapefile by attributes
departements_inhabitants_l93 <- departements_l93 %>%
 inner_join(dept_inhabitants, by = c("CODE_DEPT" = "ID_DPT"))

glimpse(departements_inhabitants_l93, width = 40)
```

### Quiz: What code do you choose to join the external classical dataset `restaurants` with the spatial dataset `france_l93` if you want to keep spatial entities but only where there is a match?

.pull-left[
*restaurants*
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(
  department = c("CALVADOS", "ALPES-MARITIMES", "CANTAL"),
  restaurants = c(1500, 3000, 2000)
)
```

+ A
```{r, eval=FALSE}
france_l93 %>% 
  group_by(restaurants)
```
+ B
```{r, eval=FALSE}
france_l93 %>% 
  left_join(restaurants)
```
+ C 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
restaurants %>% 
  inner_join(france_l93)
```
]
.pull-right[
*france_l93 (extract)*
```{r, echo=FALSE}
departements_l93 %>% 
  rename(department = NOM_DEPT) %>% 
  select(department, geometry) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  print(n = 2, width = 40)
```

+ D
```{r, eval=FALSE}
france_l93 %>% 
  inner_join(restaurants)
```
]

???
A: `group_by()` has no direct effect on datasets. Moreover, it is used with a single dataset on itself to realise grouped operations on modalities of one (or more) variables

B: `left_join()` will keep all spatial entities of the original spatial dataset and add `NA` where there is no match. This does not anwser the question to keep them only where there is a match.

C: If you want to keep spatial entities, spatial dataset needs to be the first object, otherwise `inner_join()` will be applied as usual with classical datasets

D: Correct answer

### Summary

- {dplyr} grammar on attribute table
  + `select()`, `mutate()`, `filter()`, ...
  + `inner_join()`, `left_join()`, `full_join()`, `anti_join()`, ...  
  
- {dplyr} grammar on attribute + geometry
  + `group_by()` + `summarise()`

- Note that there is also compatibility with {tidyr} functions

### Activity

- Do `Exercises: Manipulating vector data with dplyr`. 

- Fifteen minutes will be allotted for this exercise.

# Second steps in spatial data handling




---

# Wait there's more! 

--

## There are a variety of spatial functions that you can use to manipulate your data

--

- `st_crs()` : coordinates reference system
- `st_bbox()` : spatial extent
- `st_join()` : spatial left join
- `st_intersection()` : intersection join
- `st_crop()` : crop
- `st_union()` : union
- `st_difference()` : difference
- `st_area()` : area
- `st_distance()` : distance
- `st_length()` : length
- `st_centroid()` : find centroid
- `st_buffer()` : buffer area

---

## To learn more about these functions, please refer to the original [useR2020! workshop](https://github.com/statnmap/user2020_rspatial_tutorial)
